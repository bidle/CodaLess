CodaLess
========

Small Coda plug-in that compiles less files on save.

#Install

You need to have node.js installed (at /usr/local/bin/node). If you haven't already installed node.js go to http://nodejs.org, download the installer and run the install. The installer will put the files in the correct location.

Then you must have installed less (at /usr/local/lib/node_modules/less/bin/lessc). The easiest way is to run the following command once you have installed node:

	sudo npm install -g less

To install the plugin double click `CodaLess.codaplugin` or copy it to `~/Library/Application Support/Coda 2/Plug-ins`.

#Usage

Whenever you save a less file (file with extension `.less`) it will be compiled.

#Preferences

Go to `Plug-ins > CodaLess Preferences` in Coda. It's currently possible to change the output path and to minify output.
