CodaLess
========

Small Coda plug-in that compiles less files on save.

#Install

You need to have node.js installed (at /usr/local/bin/node). If you haven't already installed node.js go to http://nodejs.org, download the installer and run the install. The installer will put the files in the correct location.

Then you must have installed less (at /usr/local/lib/node_modules/less/bin/lessc). The easiest way is to run the following command once you have installed node:

	sudo npm install -g less

You can download the plugin from [Panic](http://panic.com/coda/plugins.php#Plugins) (the topmost plug in) or if you want to be sure to get the latest build download the zip from the [releases page](https://github.com/idmean/CodaLess/releases).

#Supported Less Versions

CodaLess officially supports less 2.2.0 and above.

#Minify using Clean CSS

As of 2.0.4 CodaLess no longer uses lessâ€™ minify option (which was deprecated in less 2.2.0) but the Clean CSS plugin for less which you can install by running:

    sudo npm install -g less-plugin-clean-css

You then need to check the `Use Clean CSS Plugin` in the preferences.

#Usage

Whenever you save a less file (file with extension `.less`) it will be compiled.

#Preferences

Go to `Plug-ins > CodaLess Preferences` in Coda.
